          My name is Jose Lara and I'm a full-stack web2 developer from Pasadena, California. I was previously one of the co-founders of Lalapoint, a digital marketing company. There I lead the entire technology department outfitting our data partners system that I developed from the ground up. When I'm not creating code, I enjoy throwing up docker containers, network design, and engineering with my two dogs Lola and Fluffy.
